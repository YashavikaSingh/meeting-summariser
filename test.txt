10:00:02 Laura Kim:  
All right, let’s get started. Thanks everyone for joining. The goal of today’s sync is to align on the Q2 roadmap, confirm ownership for key deliverables, and address any blockers in the AI initiative roll-out.

10:01:04 James Patel:  
Sounds good. I’ll also give a brief update on engineering bandwidth toward the end.

10:02:10 Laura Kim:  
Perfect. To kick things off—Mukhil, could you walk us through the initial trend analysis you completed on user behavior post-beta?

10:03:00 Mukhil Sundararaj Gowthaman:  
Sure. I analyzed session-level interaction logs over the past 30 days. Key insight: there’s a 22% increase in feature adoption for personalized recommendations when users receive onboarding nudges in the first session. I've dropped a visual summary in the shared doc under “User Retention Trends.”

10:05:22 Anita Rao:  
That aligns with our qualitative feedback too. Users felt more “in control” when guided. Laura, I’d recommend we prioritize micro-interaction design in the next sprint.

10:06:08 Laura Kim:  
Agreed. Let’s make that a UX priority. Anita, can your team own that and deliver mid-June?

10:06:12 Anita Rao:  
Yes, absolutely.

10:07:01 Laura Kim:  
Brian—on the marketing side, any updates on the upcoming campaign?

10:08:00 Brian Yu:  
We’re aiming for a mid-July launch. Messaging will focus on “intelligent simplicity.” We’d need finalized product positioning by June 10.

10:09:15 Laura Kim:  
Noted. Let’s sync on that next week. James—any risk of delay from engineering?

10:10:05 James Patel:  
One thing—we’re still waiting on finalized backend schema for the AI module. If we don’t have that by Thursday, we may see a slip. Mukhil, can you finalize and share that?

10:11:02 Mukhil Sundararaj Gowthaman:  
Yes, I’ll consolidate and send the updated schema by EOD tomorrow.

10:12:00 James Patel:  
Great.

10:13:10 Laura Kim:  
OK, to recap:  
- UX to deliver micro-interactions by June 14  
- Data schema finalized by tomorrow  
- Product positioning draft due by June 10  
Action items are already in the shared Notion. Let’s reconvene next Wednesday for a mid-sprint checkpoint.

10:14:20 Anita Rao:  
Sounds good.

10:14:21 James Patel:  
Will do.

10:14:22 Brian Yu:  
Thanks everyone.

10:15:00 Laura Kim:  
Thanks everyone—great momentum. Meeting adjourned.
