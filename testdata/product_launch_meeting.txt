09:00:05 Sarah Johnson:  
Good morning everyone! Thanks for joining our product launch planning session. Today we need to finalize the timeline for the Q3 launch, assign responsibilities, and address any outstanding concerns about the marketing strategy.

09:01:15 Michael Chen:  
Morning all. I've shared the latest product readiness report in the shared folder. The development team is on track to deliver all core features by July 15th, but we still have some UI refinements that might slip into the following week.

09:02:30 Priya Patel:  
Thanks for the update, Michael. From the marketing side, we've drafted the press release and social media campaign. We're planning for a soft launch on July 20th, followed by the full public announcement on July 25th. Does that timeline work with the development schedule?

09:03:45 Michael Chen:  
That should work, but it gives us very little buffer. I'd recommend pushing the soft launch to July 22nd to be safe.

09:04:20 Sarah Johnson:  
I agree with Michael. Let's build in that extra cushion. Emma, how are we looking on the customer success side?

09:05:10 Emma Rodriguez:  
We've completed the knowledge base articles and training materials for the support team. We can be ready by July 22nd, but we'll need final product documentation from David's team by July 10th to ensure everything is properly updated.

09:06:30 David Kim:  
I can commit to having the documentation ready by July 10th. One concern though - we still haven't finalized the pricing structure. We need that ASAP to complete the documentation.

09:07:45 Sarah Johnson:  
Good point, David. The executive team is meeting tomorrow to finalize pricing. I'll ensure we have that information to you by end of day tomorrow.

09:08:20 Priya Patel:  
Regarding the launch event, we've secured the venue for July 25th and have draft invitations ready to go out. We should send those by next Friday at the latest. Do we have final approval on the guest list?

09:09:40 Sarah Johnson:  
Yes, I approved the guest list yesterday. You're clear to proceed with the invitations once we confirm the pricing details.

09:10:15 Michael Chen:  
One more thing - the QA team has identified some performance issues when the system is under heavy load. We're working on optimizations, but we should prepare a contingency plan for the launch in case we see unexpected traffic spikes.

09:11:50 Emma Rodriguez:  
I can work with the infrastructure team to ensure we have adequate scaling capabilities in place. Let's schedule a separate technical review for that next week.

09:12:30 Sarah Johnson:  
Great idea, Emma. Can you coordinate that meeting? Let's aim for Tuesday or Wednesday.

09:13:05 Emma Rodriguez:  
Will do. I'll send out calendar invites by the end of today.

09:14:20 David Kim:  
Should we discuss the beta customer feedback? There were some concerns about the navigation that we might want to address before launch.

09:15:40 Michael Chen:  
The UX team is already working on those navigation improvements. They should be implemented by the end of next week, which gives us time to test before the launch.

09:16:55 Priya Patel:  
Perfect. I'll make sure our demo videos reflect those navigation changes.

09:18:10 Sarah Johnson:  
Excellent. Let's recap our action items:
- Michael's team to complete development by July 15th, with UI refinements by July 19th
- David to deliver documentation by July 10th, pending pricing information
- I'll provide pricing details by tomorrow EOD
- Priya to send out invitations by next Friday
- Emma to schedule a technical review for scaling next week
- Soft launch moved to July 22nd
- Full public launch confirmed for July 25th

Does anyone have any other concerns or items to discuss?

09:20:05 David Kim:  
All clear from my side.

09:20:10 Michael Chen:  
Nothing additional from engineering.

09:20:15 Priya Patel:  
Marketing is good to go.

09:20:20 Emma Rodriguez:  
Customer success is on track.

09:21:00 Sarah Johnson:  
Great work, everyone. Let's meet again next Thursday to check on our progress. I'll send out a calendar invite with the agenda. Meeting adjourned.
