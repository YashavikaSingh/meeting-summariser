14:00:10 Robert Chen:  
Good afternoon everyone. Thank you for joining our Q2 budget review meeting. Today we'll be reviewing our financial performance for the quarter, discussing any variances from our projections, and making adjustments to our Q3 and Q4 forecasts as needed. Let's start with an overview of the Q2 numbers.

14:01:30 Robert Chen:  
Overall, we ended the quarter with revenue at $4.2 million, which is about 8% above our projection of $3.9 million. Our expenses came in at $3.1 million, slightly under our budgeted $3.2 million. This gives us a quarterly profit of $1.1 million, which is significantly better than our projected $700,000.

14:02:45 Amanda Garcia:  
That's excellent news. Can we break down where the additional revenue came from? Was it primarily from the new enterprise contracts or the increased subscription volume?

14:03:20 Jessica Williams:  
The majority came from enterprise sales. We closed two major deals that weren't in our original forecast - the Westfield contract worth $250,000 and the GlobalTech deal at $180,000. The subscription growth was steady but only about 3% above projections.

14:04:35 Tomas Novak:  
The marketing campaigns for the enterprise segment definitely paid off. Our targeted LinkedIn campaign had a 22% conversion rate, which is double what we typically see. I'd recommend we allocate more of the Q3 marketing budget to similar campaigns.

14:05:50 Robert Chen:  
That makes sense given the results. Tomas, can you prepare a proposal for budget reallocation? I'd like to see that by next Friday.

14:06:15 Tomas Novak:  
Absolutely, I'll have that ready.

14:06:40 Raj Patel:  
On the engineering side, we managed to come in under budget primarily because we delayed the infrastructure upgrade to Q3. However, that's now becoming urgent, and I'd like to request an additional $75,000 for Q3 to complete that project.

14:07:55 Robert Chen:  
Given our strong Q2 performance, I think we can accommodate that. Raj, please send me the detailed breakdown of those costs, and we'll adjust the Q3 engineering budget accordingly.

14:08:30 Raj Patel:  
Will do. I'll have that to you by Monday.

14:09:00 Amanda Garcia:  
I'd like to discuss our hiring plan. We budgeted for 8 new positions in Q2 but only filled 5. That accounts for some of our expense savings, but we're now falling behind on several initiatives. Should we accelerate hiring in Q3?

14:10:15 Robert Chen:  
What's causing the hiring delays? Is it budget constraints or difficulty finding qualified candidates?

14:11:00 Amanda Garcia:  
It's primarily the latter. The market for senior developers and product managers is extremely competitive right now. We might need to adjust our compensation packages to attract the talent we need.

14:12:20 Raj Patel:  
I agree with Amanda. We've had several candidates decline offers because our packages weren't competitive enough, especially for senior roles. I'd recommend a 10-15% increase in the salary ranges for those positions.

14:13:40 Robert Chen:  
That's a significant adjustment. Let me work with HR to analyze the market rates and see what we can do. I'll have a proposal ready by our next executive meeting.

14:14:30 Jessica Williams:  
Looking at Q3, I'm projecting sales to reach $4.5 million based on our current pipeline. We have several major deals in the final stages that should close in July and August.

14:15:45 Robert Chen:  
That's higher than our original Q3 projection of $4.1 million. Are you confident in that number, Jessica?

14:16:10 Jessica Williams:  
I'm giving it an 80% confidence level. The deals are well advanced, and we've received verbal commitments from most of the clients. The main risk is timing - some might slip into early Q4.

14:17:25 Robert Chen:  
Let's use $4.3 million for our revised forecast to be conservative. Now, let's discuss departmental budgets for Q3. I've shared a spreadsheet with the current allocations. Please review your department's numbers and let me know if you foresee any necessary changes.

14:18:40 Tomas Novak:  
As mentioned, I'd like to increase the budget for enterprise marketing campaigns by about $50,000, which we can reallocate from the general brand awareness initiatives that didn't perform as well as expected.

14:19:55 Robert Chen:  
That seems reasonable given the results we're seeing. Anyone else?

14:20:30 Jessica Williams:  
Sales is on target with our current budget. No changes needed from my side.

14:21:05 Raj Patel:  
Other than the infrastructure upgrade I mentioned, engineering is on track with the existing budget.

14:21:40 Amanda Garcia:  
Operations will need an additional $30,000 for the office expansion we discussed last month. The contractor quotes came in higher than initially estimated.

14:22:30 Robert Chen:  
I'll add that to the revised budget. Let's summarize our action items:
1. Tomas to prepare a proposal for marketing budget reallocation by next Friday
2. Raj to send detailed infrastructure upgrade costs by Monday
3. I'll work with HR on a compensation adjustment proposal for our next executive meeting
4. We'll revise the Q3 revenue forecast to $4.3 million
5. Budget adjustments: +$75,000 for engineering infrastructure, +$50,000 for enterprise marketing (internal reallocation), and +$30,000 for office expansion

Does anyone have anything else to add before we conclude?

14:24:15 Jessica Williams:  
Just a quick note that we should start planning for the annual customer conference soon. That will impact Q4 budgets.

14:24:45 Robert Chen:  
Good point. Let's put that on the agenda for our next meeting. Thank you all for your input today. I'll circulate the revised budget by the end of next week for final review. Meeting adjourned.
