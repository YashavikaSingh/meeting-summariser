13:00:10 Dr. Samantha Chen:  
Good afternoon everyone. Thank you for joining us today for the presentation of our user research findings. Over the past six weeks, Maya and Kevin have been conducting an extensive study on user behavior and preferences for our healthcare platform. Today, they'll be sharing their key insights and recommendations. Maya, would you like to start?

13:01:30 Maya Williams:  
Thank you, Samantha. As most of you know, we conducted this research to understand how healthcare professionals are using our platform in their daily workflows and to identify opportunities for improvement. Our methodology included:
- 25 in-depth interviews with physicians, nurses, and administrative staff
- 4 on-site observations at different healthcare facilities
- A quantitative survey with 312 respondents
- Analysis of usage data from the past 12 months

13:03:15 Maya Williams:  
Let me start with our key findings about user behavior. First, we discovered that 78% of healthcare professionals access our platform primarily during three specific periods of their workday: early morning before patient rounds, during lunch breaks, and in the evening for documentation. This has significant implications for how we design our system performance and feature availability.

13:04:45 Dr. Thomas Jackson:  
That's interesting. Does this pattern vary by role? For example, do nurses show different usage patterns compared to physicians?

13:05:20 Maya Williams:  
Excellent question. Yes, we did see variations by role. Physicians tend to use the platform more heavily during morning prep and evening documentation, while nurses access it more consistently throughout their shifts, with particular spikes during shift changes. Administrative staff have more consistent usage throughout the day.

13:06:40 Kevin Park:  
If I may add to that, our data analysis showed that system load is 40% higher during these peak times, which correlates with a 15% increase in error rates and page load times. This suggests we need to optimize performance specifically for these high-traffic periods.

13:07:55 Daniel Kim:  
That's valuable information for our infrastructure planning. Are there specific features that are used more during these peak times?

13:08:30 Kevin Park:  
Yes, during morning hours, the patient summary and medication history features see the highest traffic. During evening hours, documentation and order entry features are most heavily used.

13:09:45 Maya Williams:  
Moving on to our second major finding: We identified significant pain points in the current workflow. The most frequently mentioned issues were:
1. The complexity of the documentation process, cited by 82% of participants
2. Difficulty finding relevant patient information quickly, mentioned by 67%
3. Poor integration with other hospital systems, noted by 59%
4. Limited mobile functionality, which was a concern for 52%

13:11:20 Rebecca Martinez:  
These align with the feedback we've been getting through our support channels. Did users suggest any specific improvements for these areas?

13:12:05 Maya Williams:  
They did. For documentation, users consistently requested templates and smart defaults based on common scenarios. For finding information, they wanted improved search functionality and customizable dashboards. I'll get into more detailed recommendations shortly.

13:13:30 Dr. Thomas Jackson:  
Before you move on, did you gather any insights about the competitive landscape? Are users comparing us to other systems?

13:14:15 Maya Williams:  
Yes, 43% of participants mentioned using competitor systems either previously or concurrently. The most favorable comparisons were to systems that offer customizable workflows and better mobile experiences. Specifically, MedPortal was cited as having superior documentation tools, while HealthStream was praised for its search capabilities.

13:15:40 Kevin Park:  
Our usage data supports this. We see a 23% drop in engagement when users have to switch between our system and others. Integration points are clear opportunities for improvement.

13:16:55 Maya Williams:  
That brings me to our third key finding: User preferences for future development. When asked about features they would prioritize, users consistently mentioned:
1. Voice-based documentation (76%)
2. Customizable dashboards (71%)
3. Better mobile access (68%)
4. Improved integration with wearable devices (52%)

13:18:20 Daniel Kim:  
The voice-based documentation is particularly interesting. Did you get any specifics about what they're looking for there? Full dictation or more command-based interaction?

13:19:05 Maya Williams:  
It was primarily focused on dictation for clinical notes, but with smart structuring of the content. Users want to be able to speak naturally but have the system organize the information into the appropriate sections of the medical record.

13:20:30 Dr. Samantha Chen:  
That aligns with industry trends. Did you explore the privacy and security concerns around voice technology in clinical settings?

13:21:15 Maya Williams:  
We did. 64% of participants expressed concerns about patient privacy with voice technology, particularly in shared spaces. They suggested features like proximity activation and visual indicators when recording is active.

13:22:40 Kevin Park:  
Now I'd like to share some of our quantitative findings. We analyzed user satisfaction scores across different features and found that satisfaction has a strong negative correlation with the number of clicks required to complete a task. For every additional click in a common workflow, satisfaction drops by approximately 5%.

13:24:05 Kevin Park:  
We also found that users who received training on the system reported 27% higher satisfaction scores than those who learned through trial and error. However, only 34% of our users have received formal training.

13:25:30 Rebecca Martinez:  
That's a clear opportunity. Did you gather any information about preferred training formats?

13:26:15 Kevin Park:  
Yes, short video tutorials were preferred by 58% of users, followed by interactive guides within the application at 32%. Traditional manual-based training was preferred by only 10%.

13:27:40 Maya Williams:  
Based on these findings, we've developed several recommendations:

1. Optimize system performance during peak usage times, particularly for the most commonly used features during those periods
2. Redesign the documentation workflow to reduce clicks and incorporate templates and smart defaults
3. Improve search functionality with filters specific to different user roles
4. Develop a more robust mobile experience, focusing on the most critical tasks for on-the-go users
5. Begin development of voice-based documentation with appropriate privacy safeguards
6. Create a series of short video tutorials focused on the most complex workflows

13:29:55 Dr. Thomas Jackson:  
These are excellent recommendations. Have you prioritized them in any way?

13:30:30 Maya Williams:  
Yes, we've created a prioritization matrix based on user impact and implementation complexity. The highest impact with relatively lower complexity would be the documentation workflow improvements and search functionality enhancements.

13:31:45 Daniel Kim:  
From an engineering perspective, I appreciate the focus on complexity. The voice features would require significant development time, but I can see the potential impact is substantial.

13:32:20 Kevin Park:  
We've estimated that implementing just the top three recommendations could increase user satisfaction by 35% and reduce support tickets by 28% based on our correlation analysis.

13:33:40 Dr. Samantha Chen:  
Before we open up for more questions, I'd like to highlight one more finding that I think is particularly important. Maya, could you share the insights about user context?

13:34:15 Maya Williams:  
Absolutely. We found that context switching is a major pain point for healthcare professionals. On average, they're interrupted 12 times per hour, and each interruption while using our system results in approximately 2.5 minutes of lost productivity as they reorient themselves. Features that help users quickly regain context after an interruption could significantly improve efficiency.

13:35:40 Rebecca Martinez:  
That's a fascinating insight. Did users have specific ideas about features that could help with this?

13:36:15 Maya Williams:  
They suggested visual breadcrumbs, session restoration, and the ability to leave notes or flags for themselves within the system. Some also mentioned the concept of "pause and resume" functionality for complex workflows.

13:37:40 Dr. Thomas Jackson:  
This has been incredibly informative. How do you suggest we move forward with these findings?

13:38:15 Dr. Samantha Chen:  
We've prepared a detailed report with all findings and recommendations, which we'll distribute after this meeting. We suggest forming cross-functional working groups to address each of the high-priority areas. Maya and Kevin will be available to provide additional context and data as needed.

13:39:40 Rebecca Martinez:  
I think we should also schedule follow-up sessions with the product team to incorporate these findings into our roadmap planning.

13:40:15 Dr. Samantha Chen:  
Excellent suggestion. Now, let's open the floor for questions.

13:41:30 Daniel Kim:  
I'm curious about the mobile usage patterns. Did you identify specific scenarios where mobile access was most critical?

13:42:15 Maya Williams:  
Yes, mobile usage was highest among physicians who move between different care settings, such as those who work at multiple facilities or who are frequently on call. The most common mobile use cases were reviewing patient information before arriving at a location, quick reference during rounds, and receiving notifications about critical results.

13:43:40 Rebecca Martinez:  
Did you get any feedback on our recent updates to the medication reconciliation feature?

13:44:15 Kevin Park:  
We did. The data shows a 15% improvement in task completion rates for medication reconciliation since the update. However, users still reported confusion about the difference between the various medication views. This suggests we've made progress but still have work to do in that area.

13:45:40 Dr. Thomas Jackson:  
Were there any surprising findings that contradicted our previous assumptions?

13:46:15 Maya Williams:  
One surprising finding was related to notification preferences. While we had assumed users wanted fewer notifications, 67% actually indicated they wanted more notifications, but with better filtering options and the ability to set priority levels. They value being informed but want more control over how and when they receive information.

13:47:40 Dr. Samantha Chen:  
That's a great example of why this kind of research is so valuable. Any other questions?

13:48:15 Daniel Kim:  
Did you identify any differences in preferences or behavior based on user demographics, such as age or experience level?

13:49:00 Kevin Park:  
We did see some variations. Users with less than 5 years of experience were 40% more likely to prefer mobile access and digital tools. Users with more than 15 years of experience placed higher value on system stability and consistency. However, the desire for reduced complexity and better search functionality was consistent across all experience levels.

13:50:30 Dr. Samantha Chen:  
If there are no more questions, I'd like to thank Maya and Kevin for their excellent work on this research project. The insights they've gathered will be invaluable as we plan our product development efforts.

13:51:15 Dr. Thomas Jackson:  
I agree. This is exactly the kind of data-driven approach we need to ensure we're meeting our users' needs. Thank you both for your thorough work.

13:52:00 Rebecca Martinez:  
I'll coordinate with the product team to schedule the follow-up sessions to incorporate these findings into our roadmap.

13:52:45 Dr. Samantha Chen:  
Perfect. We'll distribute the full report by the end of the day. Thank you all for your time and attention.

13:53:30 Maya Williams:  
Thank you for the opportunity to present our findings. We're excited to see how these insights will shape the product going forward.

13:54:15 Dr. Samantha Chen:  
With that, we'll conclude today's meeting. Thanks everyone.
